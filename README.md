# hugo_portfolio

Source repository for my portfolio website, which is hosted at
[https://samlarkin.github.io](https://samlarkin.github.io).

## Usage

Hugo generates the site in `public/`, which is hosted in a GitHub Pages
[repo](https://github.com/samlarkin/samlarkin.github.io). Push the generated
content to publish the site:

```
hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message..."
git push
```

## Acknowledgements

With thanks to the developers of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site
generator, and the [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

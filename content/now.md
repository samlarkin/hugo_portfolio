# Computing

## Update 2021-01-04
 
Having started off this site with a couple of pages of simple HTML and a CSS
stylesheet, I've begun reimplementing it using Flask -- a popular lightweight
web development framework for Python. This gets rid of a lot of boiler-plate
HTML and makes it very easy to extend the site -- both in terms of content and
functionality.

I'm also working on a small personal Python project to help me manage my
personal finances.

The two projects mentioned above have also prompted me to start using 
[Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) for writing documentation for my personal and
professional work.


# Reading

I've just started reading *Inferior* by Angela Saini.

I've recently decided to start taking some notes on what I read - in an
attempt to remember more of what I take the time to read. I'm trying to catch
up on what I read last year but in the future I'll try to take notes as I go
along.

My [reading list](/reading_list) will now contain links to the notes I've
recorded on each book.


# Languages

I've been studying Spanish on-and-off for about a year now and I could
really do with some practice. If you fancy a chat in Spanish, then I'd be more
than happy to hear from you. *Puede usted [escribirme](/contact) en español también.*

I'm currently living and working in Oxford, UK.


## Portfolio

I'm currently working on developing this site -- using the static site
generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) -- to act as personal portfolio.


## Data Science Skills Bootcamp

I'm currently enrolled in a [Department for Education Skills
Bootcamp](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp) in Data
Science. You can see some of the projects I've been working on
[here](/projects).


## Reading

I'm currently reading *Prisoners of Geography* by Tim Marshall.


## Languages

I've been studying Spanish on-and-off for a couple of years now. I've just
completed an intermediate (CEFR B1) course in Spanish at the University of
Oxford's [Department for Continuing Education](https://conted.ox.ac.uk) and hope to
spend some time in Spain over the coming months to help develop my skills.
